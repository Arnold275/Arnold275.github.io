I am an **engineer** in the fields of **mechatronics** and **automation** with a focus on **3D printing** and **robotics**. 

As a design-loving tinkerer and a big fan of the maker culture, I regularly create my own everyday **design objects**, automate my household items or further develop my 3D printer. 

Through my **studies** and **apprenticeship**, I have become proficient in automation, design and manufacturing processes, as well as the handling of machine tools and the electrical workshop.
