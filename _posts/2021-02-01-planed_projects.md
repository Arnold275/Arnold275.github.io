As I'm in the means of setting up my portfolio page. You won't find much here jet.\
But you can get a first peek into some of my projects and things I have done by checking out my linked profiles.


At <a href="https://github.com/jhaardt">**GitHub**</a> you can find got a ROS workspace, for a fully functioning peg in hole assembly that by only using only force control, can find the hole and fit the peg into it. And this in two environments. In a fully simulated ROS Gazebo environment and in real life using a Universal Robots UR5.

At <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/haardt">**Thingiverse**</a> I uploaded some of my 3D-Designs that I feel like sharing and could be useful for others.

At <a href="https://www.instagram.com/haardt.design/">**Instagram**</a> I posted some pictures of my 3D-Designed objects and tinkering projects that are more design based and I'm specially proud of. Most of them are so special, that I'm not planning to upload them to Thingiverse.
