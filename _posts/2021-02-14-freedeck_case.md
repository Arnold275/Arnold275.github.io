I recently came across the <a href="https://github.com/FreeYourStream"> Freedeck project</a>, which allows people to build their own customizable control pad. It's a small keyboard with keys that can be programmed to execute different marcros and functions. As a special feature, each key has an own small display, which can show icons to explain the functionality underneath.

While taking a first glance into the project, I noticed that some dimensions had changed in the last PCB revision and there was no longer a suitable case for it. At the same time, there was a GitHub request for a 3D model of the PCB to help with the creation of cases. After a quick look at the PCB files provided, I decided to tackle this task and create a 3D PCB model and provide it as a .step file, to make it compatible with most design software.

At the moment, I have not been able to verify the correct dimensions, as the electrical parts are still in shipping due to the Chinese New Year festival. But other users on Discord have confirmed the Dimensions as:" Your model looks pretty accurate including the SD Card reader protrusion, USB connection and holes. I have a slightly larger gap between the 2 rows on the OLEDs, but that's probably due to the different manufacturers."

After creating the PCB, I decided to design a case as well.

Here you can see a first rendering. I have already 3D printed it and will publish the files after I have made minor adjustments and could check the correct fitment. For that, I also need to wait for the electrical parts.
